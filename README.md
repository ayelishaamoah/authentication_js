# User Authentication JavaScript

The purpose of this project is to explore concepts covered throughout the course but in a language of my choice.

I would like to gain more exposure to JavaScript as this is a language I forsee myself using during my career as a software engineer. Initially I would have like to build more features into but I wanted to timebox this project and decided to focus on setting up the backend and testing.

### Personal objectives
* Get a node project up and running
* Implement user authentication
* Understand end to end testing for a JavaScript app
* Gain experience using a No SQL database

### Tech Stack
JavaScript
Express
Cypress
Jasmine
MongoDB

### Getting started
```js
$ git clone 'https://github.com/ayelishaamoah/makersbnb_js.git'
$ npm install //install packages listed in package.json
$ npm run server //this will run the 'server' script in package.json
```

### Running Tests

Open ```SpecRunner.html``` in the browser

Running end to end tests using cyprus
